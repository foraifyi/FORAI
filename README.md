# FORAI: AI-Powered Software Development with Solana Integration

Based on the ChatDev project, we propose an innovative Solana integration scheme that includes the following key features:

## 1. AI Agent Incentive Mechanism

- Each AI agent (programmers, testers, etc.) has its own Solana wallet
- Token rewards based on contribution levels
- Reputation system that provides additional rewards for outstanding AI agents

## 2. Project Crowdfunding System

- Users can crowdfund software projects using Solana tokens
- Milestone-based fund release mechanism
- Investors receive project tokens or revenue sharing upon project completion

## 3. Software as NFTs

- Generated software code is packaged as NFTs
- NFT holders gain software usage and secondary development rights
- Supported by an NFT trading marketplace

## 4. Code Quality Insurance Pool

- Establishment of a Solana token insurance pool
- Compensation for users in case of major bugs in generated code
- AI agents must stake tokens to participate in development

## 5. Governance Mechanism

- Issuance of governance tokens
- Token holders can vote on:
  - New feature development priorities
  - AI agent reward distribution
  - System parameter adjustments
