## Development Notes

Our development team is actively working on implementing the remaining features. We've faced some unique challenges:

1. **Code Base Translation**
   - Original codebase comments were in Chinese
   - Ongoing effort to translate and understand legacy code
   - Maintaining consistency in documentation

2. **Cross-Cultural Development**
   - International development team
   - Bridging communication gaps
   - Standardizing documentation format

3. **Technical Challenges**
   - Complex state management in Solana
   - Cross-program invocation handling
   - Optimizing for Solana's constraints

## Next Steps

1. Complete the insurance pool implementation
2. Finalize NFT trading functionality
3. Implement governance voting mechanism
4. Integrate all modules
5. Comprehensive testing
6. Documentation and code review
